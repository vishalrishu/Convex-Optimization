\section*{Question}
{\bf What is Slaterâ€™s constraint qualification? Give relevant equations.}
\\
{\bf Ans. -} 
\\
As we know, Strong duality usually holds for convex problems and Constraint qualifications are the conditions for strong duality in convex problems.
\\
\\
Convex problem is:
\begin{align*}
minimise. \quad& f_0(x)\\
subject.to. \quad& f_i(x) \le 0  \quad i=1,\ldots,m
\\
Lagrangian:\\
L(x,\lambda) &= f_0(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i f_i(x)
\end{align*}
Slater's constraint ensures that strong duality holds for convex problems.
\\
There are two assumptions for slater's theorem:
\\
i) Our objective function $f_{0}$ and the constraints should be convex.
\\
ii) Optimal problem is finite.
\\
Slater's theorem states that there should be a slater vector x' for which,
\begin{align*}
\quad& f_i(x') < 0 for \quad i=1,\ldots,m
\end{align*}
If these conditions fulfilled then we can say that:
\\
i) There is Strong Duality i.e. $p^*$ = $d^*$
\\
ii) Optimal solution of convex problem is bounded and non-empty.
